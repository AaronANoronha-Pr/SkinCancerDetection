# SkinCancerDetection
Skin cancer is a very significant global health concern, with an increasing incidence rate and potential for maturity, Early and accurate diagnosis is very crucial for effective treatment and improve the patient’s outcomes. Machine learning techniques particularly deep learning algorithms have shown promising results in automated skin cancer detection.

The HAM10000 dataset consists of 10,015 high-quality dermatoscopic images of skin lesions that provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating ML models. Each image is associated with metadata, including patient information and lesion characteristics. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of skin lesions, including melanoma, melanocytic nevus, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, benign keratosis, dermatofibroma, and vascular lesion.

It shows the distribution of different types of lesions

The implementation of Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory architectures for skin lesion classification in this report have achieved an accuracy of 95% and 96% for LSTM and CNN respectively. The report discusses data pre-processing, model making and training, and evaluation metrics. Results analysis demonstrates the models’ efficiency in capturing relevant patters and features from the images.

An accuracy of 95% in the LSTM Model:
